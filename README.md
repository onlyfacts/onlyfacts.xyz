# OnlyFacts

OnlyFacts is a website to get the full perspective of the pandemic.
It is a flask-based application which serves up categories with facts and sources.

Sorry about my awful skills with web design. I like to work with backend more anyway.

All it needs is a reCaptcha key and possibly an email.
